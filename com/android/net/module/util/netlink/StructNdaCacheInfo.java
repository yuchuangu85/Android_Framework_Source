     * Explanatory notes, for reference.
     *
     * Before being returned to user space, the neighbor entry times are
     * converted to clock_t's like so:
     *
     *     ndm_used      = jiffies_to_clock_t(now - neigh->used);
     *     ndm_confirmed = jiffies_to_clock_t(now - neigh->confirmed);
     *     ndm_updated   = jiffies_to_clock_t(now - neigh->updated);
     *
     * meaning that these values are expressed as "clock ticks ago".  To
     * convert these clock ticks to seconds divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK).
     * When _SC_CLK_TCK is 100, for example, the ndm_* times are expressed
     * in centiseconds.
     *
     * These values are unsigned, but fortunately being expressed as "some
     * clock ticks ago", these values are typically very small (and
     * 2^31 centiseconds = 248 days).
     *
     * By observation, it appears that:
     *     ndm_used: the last time ARP/ND took place for this neighbor
     *     ndm_confirmed: the last time ARP/ND succeeded for this neighbor OR
     *                    higher layer confirmation (TCP or MSG_CONFIRM)
     *                    was received
     *     ndm_updated: the time when the current NUD state was entered
