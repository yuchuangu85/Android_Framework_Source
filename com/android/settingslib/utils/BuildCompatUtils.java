     * increases (i.e., from R to S), this does not stop working.

     * <p>Supported configurations:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>For current Android release: when new API is not finalized yet (CODENAME = "S", SDK_INT
     *       = 30|31)
     *   <li>For current Android release: when new API is finalized (CODENAME = "REL", SDK_INT = 31)
     *   <li>For next Android release (CODENAME = "T", SDK_INT = 30+)
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Note that Build.VERSION_CODES.S cannot be used here until final SDK is available, because
     * it is equal to Build.VERSION_CODES.CUR_DEVELOPMENT before API finalization.
