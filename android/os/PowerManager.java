     * easier for tools to aggregate similar wake locks. When collecting
     * debugging data, the platform only monitors a finite number of tags,
     * using constants will help tools to provide better debugging data.
     * <li>avoid using Class#getName() or similar method since this class name
     * can be transformed by java optimizer and obfuscator tools.
     * <li>avoid wrapping the tag or a prefix to avoid collision with wake lock

     * Note that this only attempts to track the headroom of slow-moving sensors, such as the skin
     * temperature sensor. This means that there is no benefit to calling this function more
     * frequently than about once per second, and attempts to call significantly more frequently may
     * result in the function returning {@code NaN}.
     * <p>
     * In addition, in order to be able to provide an accurate forecast, the system does not attempt
     * to forecast until it has multiple temperature samples from which to extrapolate. This should
     * only take a few seconds from the time of the first call, but during this time, no forecasting
     * will occur, and the current headroom will be returned regardless of the value of
     * {@code forecastSeconds}.
     * <p>
     * The value returned is a non-negative float that represents how much of the thermal envelope
     * is in use (or is forecasted to be in use). A value of 1.0 indicates that the device is (or
     * will be) throttled at {@link #THERMAL_STATUS_SEVERE}. Such throttling can affect the CPU,
     * GPU, and other subsystems. Values may exceed 1.0, but there is no implied mapping to specific
     * thermal status levels beyond that point. This means that values greater than 1.0 may
     * correspond to {@link #THERMAL_STATUS_SEVERE}, but may also represent heavier throttling.
     * <p>
     * A value of 0.0 corresponds to a fixed distance from 1.0, but does not correspond to any
     * particular thermal status or temperature. Values on (0.0, 1.0] may be expected to scale
     * linearly with temperature, though temperature changes over time are typically not linear.
     * Negative values will be clamped to 0.0 before returning.
     *
     * @param forecastSeconds how many seconds in the future to forecast. Given that device
     *                        conditions may change at any time, forecasts from further in the
     *                        future will likely be less accurate than forecasts in the near future.
     * @return a value greater than or equal to 0.0 where 1.0 indicates the SEVERE throttling
     *         threshold, as described above. Returns NaN if the device does not support this
     *         functionality or if this function is called significantly faster than once per
