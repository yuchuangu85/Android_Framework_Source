/**
 * Object that describes how to run a remote animation.
 * <p>
 * A remote animation lets another app control the entire app transition. It does so by
 * <ul>
 *     <li>using {@link ActivityOptions#makeRemoteAnimation}</li>
 *     <li>using {@link IWindowManager#overridePendingAppTransitionRemote}</li>
 * </ul>
 * to register a {@link RemoteAnimationAdapter} that describes how the animation should be run:
 * Along some meta-data, this object contains a callback that gets invoked from window manager when
 * the transition is ready to be started.
 * <p>
 * Window manager supplies a list of {@link RemoteAnimationTarget}s into the callback. Each target
 * contains information about the activity that is animating as well as
 * {@link RemoteAnimationTarget#leash}. The controlling app can modify the leash like any other
 * {@link SurfaceControl}, including the possibility to synchronize updating the leash's surface
 * properties with a frame to be drawn using
 * {@link SurfaceControl.Transaction#deferTransactionUntil}.
 * <p>
 * When the animation is done, the controlling app can invoke
 * {@link IRemoteAnimationFinishedCallback} that gets supplied into
 * {@link IRemoteAnimationRunner#onStartAnimation}
 *
 * @hide
