     * The transform hint can be used by a buffer producer to pre-rotate the rendering such that the

     * conjunction with the h/w composer HAL in situations where it cannot handle rotations or
     * handle them with an additional power cost.
     *
     * The transform hint should be used with ASurfaceControl APIs when submitting buffers.
     * Example usage:
     *
     * 1. After a configuration change, before dequeuing a buffer, the buffer producer queries the
     *    function for the transform hint.
     *
     * 2. The desired buffer width and height is rotated by the transform hint.
     *
     * 3. The producer dequeues a buffer of the new pre-rotated size.
     *
     * 4. The producer renders to the buffer such that the image is already transformed, that is
     *    applying the transform hint to the rendering.
     *
     * 5. The producer applies the inverse transform hint to the buffer it just rendered.
     *
     * 6. The producer queues the pre-transformed buffer with the buffer transform.
     *
     * 7. The composer combines the buffer transform with the display transform.  If the buffer
     *    transform happens to cancel out the display transform then no rotation is needed and there
     *    will be no performance penalties.
     *
     * Note, when using ANativeWindow APIs in conjunction with a NativeActivity Surface or
     * SurfaceView Surface, the buffer producer will already have access to the transform hint and
     * no additional work is needed.
