 * <p>Z axis is vertical along the plane of the device with positive Z pointing up and negative z
 * pointing towards bottom of the device Y axis is horizontal along the plane of the device with
 * positive Y pointing towards right of the phone screen and negative Y pointing towards left X axis
 * is orthogonal to the Y-Z plane (phone screen), pointing away from the phone screen for positive X
 * and pointing away from back of the phone for negative X.
